# Deep_Learning
This Repository is based on my Deep Learning Understanding.  

1. Tensor_basics:  
   a. 1-D Scalar Vectors.  
   b. 2-D Scalar Vectors.  
   c. Tensors with random values.  
   d. Tensor as a list. 
   e. Mathematical calculations(Elemenet-wise opeations, In-Place calculations)  
   f. Slicing a Tensor.  
   g. Reshaping a Tensor.  
   h. Converting Numpy to Tensor and Vice-verca.  
   i. Activating GPU.
